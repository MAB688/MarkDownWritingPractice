## How to Plant a Garden ##

### Step 1: Planning ###

* Pick a proper location for your garden.
* Remember: your garden will need sunlight and soil that drains well.

### Step 2: More Planning ###

* Plan out the space for your garden, and remove the top layer of soil.
* Note: For beginners, a small garden is best so dig out a 7 x 7 foot square. This is the perfect size for approximately 3 vegetables with 3 plants each.

### Step 3: Vegetables ###

* Find which vegetables grow the best in your region.
* Do some research, go to your local garden center, or even ask a friend.
* Make sure to find out how long the vegetables take to grow and how to know when they are ready to be harvested.
* Pick 3-5 vegetables to grow and buy the seeds.

### Step 4: Buying Supplies ###

* Now, it's time to prepare to plant your garden.
* On a piece of paper, draw a rectangle and plan where you will plant your vegetables.
* Next, you will need to buy a few more items:
	* Gardening tools such as a shovel, a garden trowel, a rake
	* Gardening gloves
	* Fertilizer
	* A water hose
	* Extra soil

### Step 5: Preparing the Land ###

* Now, it's time to plant!
* Start by leveling the soil out by adding soil where needed and removing rocks or other debris. 
* Note: dragging a rake over the ground can help make it level.
* Next, add fertilizer or mulch. Make sure the ground stays level throughout.

### Step 6: Planting your Vegetables ###

* Each of your plant seeds should state what depth they need to be buried. Follow those instructions and bury your seeds in the fertilizer/soil.
* Tip: Try to keep each vegetable in a line or in a square area to make keeping track of growth easier.
* Tip: You can also use string attached to small wooden stakes to section off areas of your garden.

### Step 7: Taking Care ###

* The top layer of your soil should always be moist to allow the seeds to grow and to avoid the plants from drying out.
* You may also want to pull weeds once a week to keep your garden clean and healthy. 
* Tip: Use the small trowel to dig up weeds.

### Step 8: Tracking ###

* Buy a small notebook to keep track of your gardening.
* Use a ruler or measuring tape to measure your plants and record the height in your notebook. 
* Measure the height 1-2 times a week.
* Tip: You can also take pictures to record your plants growth.
* When the time comes, harvest your vegetables and enjoy!
